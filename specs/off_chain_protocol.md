# Off-Chain Protocol (OCP)

The Off-Chain protocol is an API and payload specification to support compliance, privacy and scalability on blockchains.
It is executed between pairs of _Virtual Asset Service Providers_ (VASPs),
such as wallets, exchanges or designated dealers and allows them to privately exchange payment information
before, while, or after settling it on a Blockchain.

An open source implementation of the Off-Chain Protocols is available at:
